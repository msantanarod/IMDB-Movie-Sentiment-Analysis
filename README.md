# IMDB-Movie-Ratings-Sentiment-Analysis
The goal of this project is to classify the tone behind each movie review of the dataset into three different categories: positive, neutral and negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  

ðŸ“ˆ Data: For this project I downloaded the dataset [IMDB Movie Ratings Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/imdb-movie-ratings-sentiment-analysis?select=movie.csv) from Kaggle.

  <li> Text: It contains 40.000 movie reviews</li>
  <li>Label: It has two values: 1 for positive and 0 for negative reviews</li>
</ol>

ðŸ”¬ Methodology: Python is the primary tool for the data analysis and visualization. Morever, Github shall be used for Project management.
